## Welcome to the NYCEM GIS GitHub page! 🙌

## Searching for a Repository
Our repositories are organized using topics. To find any repository within our GitHub organization use the following phrase in the search bar: `org:NYCEM-GIS`
* Include topic keywords to search for specific repos. Example: `org:NYCEM-GIS application`
  * Using topics will search for repos that match all keywords. Example: `org:NYCEM-GIS application gis-day`
  * The above method will display results for any repository or file with the keyword. Use `topic:` to specifically search for that topic.
